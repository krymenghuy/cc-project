              </div>
              <p class="ql-size-lang">Oversight is one of the key functions of
                the Country Coordinating Mechanisms. According to Requirement 3
                of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
                (Global Fund) guidelines for CCMs, each CCM must have an
                oversight plan and follow this plan. To implement its oversight
                plan, the CCC needs to have an oversight body in place. CCC
                established the Oversight Committee as a permanent CCC committee
                to perform this task.
              </p>
              <p class="ql-size-lang">
                The Oversight Committee is responsible for contributing to
                effective oversight of all Global Fund financed programs and
                related processes in Cambodia, in accordance with the functions
                delegated to it by the Cambodia Country Coordinating Committee
                for the Global Fund (“the CCC”) as defined in the CCC Governance
                Manual and these Terms of Reference. The Committee assists the
                CCC to fulfill its responsibility to hold Principal Recipients
                accountable for resources given to the country: “CCMs are
                required to put in place and maintain a transparent, documented
                process to … oversee program implementation”.[1]

              <p class="ql-size-lang">
                The Oversight Committee shall consist of two Co-Chairs and
                up to fifteen Ordinary Members, endorsed by the CCC and
                divided in three disease subgroups. Membership of the CCC is
                not a prerequisite for membership of the Oversight Committee
                but at least one of the Co-Chairs must be the CCC member.
                Members of the oversight committee shall not be
                representatives of Principal Recipients. Sub-recipients or
                sub-sub-recipients maybe invited to select OC meetings to
                provide input on technical matters, however to mitigate COI
                they should not be involved in any discussion or decision
                directly related to their institution/organization/agency.
              </p>
              <p class="ql-size-lang">
                The CCC shall invite and endorse members of the Oversight
                Committee, based on propositions made by the Oversight
                Committee. Candidates who are non-CCC members will be
                required to complete the same conflict of interest
                declarations prepared by all CCC members. The CCC will
                determine whether, based on the non-CCC candidate’s
                declaration, he/she meets the standard for conflict of
                interest required for members of the Oversight Committee.
                Oversight Committee members are appointed under the same
                terms and conditions as regular CCC members.
              </p>
              <p class="ql-size-lang">
                The Global Fund minimum standards require that “the OC
                should have access to skills in the following:
                disease-specific skills, program management, financial
                management and procurement and supply management. In
                addition, ideally there should be representation of KAP and
                PLWD”. Thus the CCC Oversight Committee will ensure that a
                broad set of skills are represented among members. A such,
                the following expertise is encouraged:

                weeks prior to each regular quarterly CCC meeting, so that
                Committee deliberations may be reported to the CCC. When
                possible, the Oversight Committee should receive the
                appropriate supporting documents from the CCC in time for
                each regular meeting, in order to fulfill its oversight
